    <!-- Help Firmware -->
    <string name="firmware_0">Basic Firmware Information</string>
    <string name="firmware_1">Firmware information is made of 3 information. Build version, CSC version, and baseband version.\n\nLet\'s suppose that firmware search result is\nA720SKSU3BRK1/A720SSKC3BRK1/A720NKOU3BRK1\n\nFirst one(A720SKSU3BRK1) refers build version,\nsecond one(A720SSKC3BRK1) refers CSC version,\nlast one(A720NKOU3BRK1) refers baseband version.</string>
    <string name="firmware_2">What do we know with firmware version?</string>
    <string name="firmware_3">All we need to care is build version. We can analyze firmware with build version.\nHere is example build version:</string>
    <string name="firmware_4" translatable="false">A720SKS</string>
    <string name="firmware_5" translatable="false">U3</string>
    <string name="firmware_6" translatable="false">B</string>
    <string name="firmware_7" translatable="false">R</string>
    <string name="firmware_8" translatable="false">K</string>
    <string name="firmware_9" translatable="false">1</string>
    <string name="firmware_10">Red text</string>
    <string name="firmware_11">Red text (ex. U3) means bootloader version.\n\nDue to Samsung\'s security policy, you cannot downgrade from higher bootloader version firmware to lower bootloader version firmware.</string>
    <string name="firmware_12">Yellow text</string>
    <string name="firmware_13">Yellow text (ex. B) means Android OS version.\nIf yellow text is updated, it means Android OS is gonna be or has been updated.\n\nA means very first Android OS version.\nB means Android OS has been updated once.\nC means Android OS has been updated twice.\n.\n.\n.\nZ means beta firmware.</string>
    <string name="firmware_14">Green text</string>
    <string name="firmware_15">Green text (ex. R) means year when firmware was built.\n\nR means 2018,\nS means 2019,\nT means 2020, and so on.</string>
    <string name="firmware_16">Blue text</string>
    <string name="firmware_17">Blue text (ex. K) means month when firmware was built.\n\nA means January,\nB means February,\n.\n.\n.\nL means December.</string>
    <string name="firmware_18">Purple text</string>
    <string name="firmware_19">Purple text (ex. 1) means how many times firmware was built.\n\n1 means firmware was built once.\n.\n.\n.\n9 means firmware was built 9 times.\nA means firmware was built 10 times.\n.\n.\n.\nZ means firmware was built 35 times.</string>
    <string name="firmware_20">When will test firmware be released?</string>
    <string name="firmware_21">We cannot exactly assume it. But test firmware will be released soon if build version doesn\'t change more.</string>

    <string name="function_5">Welcome Search</string>
    <string name="function_6">Search specific device\'s firmware on app start. For preventing overload, only one device is allowed.</string>
    <string name="function_7">Data Saver</string>
    <string name="function_8">Firmware searching / Checking latest version / Info Catcher requires internet connection. Data Saver makes these processes working only on Wi-Fi.</string>
    <string name="function_9">Smart Search</string>
    <string name="function_10">It predicts latest test firmware information. Whenever user searches firmware, Smart Search will connect to database and saves search results. CheckFirm predicts information using these saved information. Turning on Smart Search will make search speed slow.</string>
    <string name="function_11">Info Catcher</string>
    <string name="function_12">If something is changed in DB, FCM will send a notification to users who subscribed to specific topic. Before use Info Catcher, you should turn on Smart Search because Smart Search is a bridge CheckFirm to DB. Turning on Info Catcher will make search speed slow.\n\nI will not make realtime update notification because it is not efficient. Since there are a lot of data in DB, it is extremely inefficient to check changes.</string>
